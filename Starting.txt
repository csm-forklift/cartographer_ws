This code works for Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic 
How to compile after ANY change to the files:

catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja

also you source the package using:
 
source cartographer_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash

Additionally, we have the ouster_ros packages setup for you to use as well.
Except we need to make a few changes for the specific computer once that is
setup to run the code. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!
